# Crypto-Pricing

###  Collaborators:  
Bimla Basnet,
Cameron Ewan,
Bob Ciminera


## Overview

The purpose of this project is to determine if there is a clustering of factors that drive change in crypto currency pricing based on the past 12 month change in pricing using USD as the constant exchange currency.

 The team will develop a machine learning model and attempt to predict trajectory of pricing based on a dataset of features gathered from various sources.  These sources include API inputs from coingecko.com as well as other sources that may be necessary to build a rich feature set.

This topic was selected based on our belief that cryptocurrencies and their associated blockchain technologies are a new model for computing and represent a significant opportunity for value and wealth creation.  

The questions we hope to answer with the data are as follows:

- What features are indicative of the pricing of a specific coin?
- Are there specific classes of coins that have better pricing performance?
- Are there any other data that we would need beyond our initial scope to create a better model?

## Project Deliverables

This project will have 4 segments of specific deliverables for each segment due on the following dates: June 27, July 11, July 18, and July 25.  During the week of July 18 there will be a live presentation.

Deliverables for June 27 are described below.

### Git Hub Repository

A git hub repository named Crypto-Pricing has been set up with branches for each member of the team according to their roles.  Additional branches will be created and merged for specific tasks and then merged into the main branch during the course of the project.

In addition to github communication among the team members will be via slack channel and scheduled zoom calls.

June 27 Deliverables:
- At least one branch for each team member
- Each team member has at least four commits from the duration of the first segment

### Machine Learning Model

June 27 Deliverables:

A machine learning model will be created by to stand in for the final machine learning model and will accomplish the following:
- Takes in data in from the provisional database
- Outputs label(s) for input data

### Database

June 27 Deliverables:

A provisional database will be created as a mockup for the final database to accomplish the following:
- Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
- Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database

## Summary

It is our desire to build a machine learning model to predict future prices over a 12 month horizon with a reasonable amount of accuracy.
